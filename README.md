## Info

This repository contains my assignments for FA22 Web Programming web-based (virtual) course of Indiana University, US. The course was also available for students from Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences in Helsinki, Finland.

## Final assignment (Module 15)

For the final assignment I made a simple event calendar where one can add, edit and delete events. The database has two tables (events & categories) and one event can only belong to one category.

_I did not include the database table creation scripts in this repository. Also the credentials in the database connection script are not accurate for security purposes._
